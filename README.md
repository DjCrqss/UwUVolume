# UwUVolume
This tiny app rests in your system tray and when a volume key is pressed, it will display a progress bar on your Wooting UwU. Perfect for users who turn their device into a media controller when not used in gaming.
The bar is white and supports gradients for granular volume display on its 8-segment bar
